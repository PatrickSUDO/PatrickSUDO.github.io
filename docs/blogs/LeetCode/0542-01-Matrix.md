### Problem: <br/>

Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

#### Example 1:

    Input:
    [[0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [0,0,0]]

    Output:
    [[0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [0,0,0]]

#### Example 2:

    Input:
    [[0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [1,1,1]]

    Output:
    [[0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [1,2,1]]


#### Note:

- The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
- There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
- The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

### Solution: <br/>

BFS is an excellent way to solve problems of finding the distance. To implement BFS, we can make use of the queue. We label all the cells with 1 as -1 and put 0 in the queue. Because the shortest distance of the cell with 0 is 0(itself), we only need to change to one with 1. The distance cannot be negative, so we choose -1 as a way of encoding. We pop the elements in the queue and check if the label is -1, and update its distance. Next, put all the valid and unseen cell into the queue.

#### Python
```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, matrix):
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])        
        q = deque()
        visited = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    q.append((i, j))
                    visited[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    matrix[i][j] = -1
                    
 
        dx = [1, -1, 0, 0]        
        dy = [0, 0, 1, -1]
        
        distance = 0
        while q:
            l = len(q)
            for _ in range(l):
                i, j = q.popleft()

                if matrix[i][j] == -1: matrix[i][j] = distance

                for k in range(4):
                    y = i + dx[k]
                    x = j + dy[k]
                    if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m and visited[y][x] != 1:
                        q.append((y, x))
                        visited[y][x] = 1
            distance += 1
        return matrix

#### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] updateMatrix(int[][] matrix) {

        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    q.offer(new int[]{i, j});
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                } else {
                    matrix[i][j] = -1;
                }
            }
        }

        int[] dx = {1, -1, 0, 0};
        int[] dy = {0, 0, 1, -1};
        int distance = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int l = 0; l < size; l++) {
                int[] node = q.poll();
                int i = node[0], j = node[1];
                if (matrix[i][j] == -1) matrix[i][j] = distance;
                for (int k = 0; k < dx.length; k++) {
                    int x = j + dx[k];
                    int y = i + dy[k];
                    if (x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= m || visited[y][x]) continue;
                    visited[y][x] = true;
                    q.offer(new int[]{y, x});
                }

            }
            distance++;
        }
        return matrix;
